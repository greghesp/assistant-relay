## Casting Remote Media

> By definition, remote media includes items such as YouTube videos, Twitch streams etc

It is possible to cast media from [several hundred](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) sites

To start casting, send a HTTP POST request to `/cast` with the following json-encoded body parameter:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"device": "192.168.1.11", // IP address or name
	"source": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xSxXiHwMrg", // URL to media
	"type": "remote" // Not needed for remote files
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
device: STRING
source: STRING
type: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
    "success": true
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the media has finished playing, the cast will automatically close

## Casting Local Media

> Local Media files are those that are somewhere on the operating system.

Having the ability to cast local media, means that it is now possible to have Assistant Relay trigger a ringing sound when your doorbell is pressed, an alarm if someone
breaks into your house, or anything else you could think of.

To cast a local file, send a HTTP POST request to `/cast` with the following json-encoded body:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"device": "192.168.1.11", // Device name or IP
	"source": "C:\Users\Dave\Downloads\HelloWorld.mp3",
	"type": "local"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
device: STRING
source: STRING
type: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
    "success": true
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> **NOTE**:  There is a bug with Smart Speakers and Displays where the cast session stays in progress after local media has been played.  This can be seen by the black screen with the cast icon inside it.  With the latest version of CATT, there is a workaround that will kill the Cast session once finished. You may hear the cast sound again whilst the session is being killed.

## Casting Websites

`CATT` also allows you to cast websites straight to your Chromecasts or Smart Displays

To cast a website, send a HTTP POST request to `/cast` with the following json-encoded body:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"device": "192.168.1.11", // Device name or IP
	"source": "www.facebook.com",
	"type": "website"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
device: STRING
source: STRING
type: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
// No response.... yet
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> **NOTE**:  Smart Displays have no keyboard interface, so a website must provide its own text entry method if needed
