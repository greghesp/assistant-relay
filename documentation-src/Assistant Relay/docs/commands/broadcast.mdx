Passing commands to Assistant Relay is as simple as calling the `/assistant` endpoint with the correct parameters

## Sending a broadcast command

A broadcast sends a message to everyone in your home, by broadcasting a message on all of your Google Home devices

To send a broadcast command, simply send a HTTP POST request with the following json-encoded body parameter:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"command": "hello world",
	"broadcast": true,
	"user": "greg" // Match the name of the users you setup
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
command: STRING
broadcast: BOOLEAN
user: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
	"success": true, // Or false
	"response": "", // Contains the text response from Google Assistant if applicable
	"audio": "/server/audio?v=1581510182698", // A URL to the audio response from Google Assistant
	"error": "Error Message" // Only shown if success if false
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Google Home device will now play a broadcast that says Hello World



### Limitations

As Assistant Relay uses the Google Assistant Service, there are some limitations to the environment that this can operate in.

* By Google's design, a broadcast goes out to **all** Google Home devices.  This cannot be changed.
* For broadcasts to work, Assistant Relay **must** be running on the same local network as the Google Home devices you wish to broadcast to.
* In addition, some users have reported issues when IPV6 is enabled on their router.  We recommend disabling IPV6 support on your router.
