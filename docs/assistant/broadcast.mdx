Passing commands to Assistant Relay is as simple as calling the `/api/assistant` endpoint with the correct parameters

## Custom Broadcasts

### Broadcast to All

By default, a broadcast sends a message to everyone in your home, by broadcasting a message on all of your Google Home devices

To send a broadcast command, simply send a HTTP POST request to `/api/assistant` with the following json-encoded body parameter:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"command": "hello world",
	"broadcast": true,
	"user": "greg" // Match the name of the users you setup
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
command: STRING
broadcast: BOOLEAN
user: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
	"success": true, // Or false
	"response": "", // Contains the text response from Google Assistant if applicable
	"audio": "/server/audio?v=1581510182698", // A URL to the audio response from Google Assistant
	"error": "Error Message" // Only shown if success if false
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Google Home device will now play a broadcast that says Hello World on all devices

### Broadcast to Device

It is now possible to send a broadcast to an individual Google Home device

Sending a broadcast to a single device is done by adding a 'device' value to the [Broadcast to All](#broadcast-to-all) command.
Simply send a HTTP POST request to `/api/assistant` with the following json-encoded body parameter:



```json highlight={4}
{
	"command": "hello world",
	"broadcast": true,
	"device": "Office Speaker",
	"user": "greg" // Match the name of the users you setup
}
```


## Preset Broadcasts
Google Assistant supports a number of preset broadcasts of our the box.  These can come with sound effects and other surprises that can be found [here](https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7531913?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en)

To make use of these presets, send a HTTP POST request to `/api/assistant` with the following json-encoded body parameters

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"preset": "dinner",
	"user": "greg" // Match the name of the users you setup
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
preset: STRING
user: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
	"success": true, // Or false
	"response": "", // Contains the text response from Google Assistant if applicable
	"audio": "/server/audio?v=1581510182698", // A URL to the audio response from Google Assistant
	"error": "Error Message" // Only shown if success if false
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Google Home device will now play a broadcast using the Assistant `dinner` preset

### Presets

The available presets that can be send are:

* wakeup
* breakfast
* lunch
* dinner
* timetoleave
* arrivedhome
* ontheway
* movietime
* tvtime
* bedtime

> **Note**: Some of these preconfigured commands also say who triggered the command, such as the 'on the way' command. Make sure you pass the correct username in the user parameter, otherwise it will use the first user you setup

As with regular broadcasts, the preset commands can also be sent to a single device by passing a `device` parameter:

```json
{
	"preset": "dinner",
	"device": "Living Room Hub",
	"user": "greg" // Match the name of the users you setup
}
```


## Limitations

As Assistant Relay uses the Google Assistant Service, there are some limitations to the environment that this can operate in.

* For broadcasts to work, Assistant Relay **must** be running on the same local network as the Google Home devices you
wish to broadcast to.
* In addition, some users have reported issues when IPV6 is enabled on their router.  We recommend disabling IPV6
support on your router.
* As the broadcasts are done via the SDK, you cannot reply to these broadcasts.
